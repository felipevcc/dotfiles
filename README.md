## Note
In my bspwm I used a python script so every time I start bspwm the wallpaper changes. Inside the script I call a folder where I keep all the wallpapers. If you want to use the script you should set your wallpapers folder path [here](https://github.com/felipevcc/dotfiles/blob/main/bspwm/scripts/wallpaper.py), if you want to disable the script you should comment line 51 of bspwmrc and uncomment line 48 to set a wallpaper path.

## Credits
* The polybar configuration is based on [siduck's dotfiles](https://github.com/siduck/dotfiles) and currently I am also making use of the [Nvchad](https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad) configuration. 
* The cava color palette was taken from [here](https://github.com/lokesh-krishna/dotfiles/tree/main/catppuccin).
* I also used [Prayags Spotify modules setup](https://github.com/PrayagS/polybar-spotify).
