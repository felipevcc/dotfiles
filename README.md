## Note
In my bspwm I used a python script so every time I start bspwm the wallpaper changes. Inside the script I call a folder where I keep them all.
To set only one wallpaper you need to comment out line 51 of bspwmrc and uncomment line 48 to set your own

## Credits
The polybar configuration is based on [siduck's dotfiles](https://github.com/siduck/dotfiles). Currently I am also making use of the [Nvchad](https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad) configuration. 

And I also used [Prayags Spotify modules setup](https://github.com/PrayagS/polybar-spotify).
